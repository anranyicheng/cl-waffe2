> __⚠️ cl-waffe2 is still in the concept stage and has a limited feature. Also, things are subject to change. DO NOT USE CL-WAFFE2 IN YOUR PRODUCT__

cl-waffe2 provides a set of differentiable matrix operations which is aimed to apply to build neural network models on Common Lisp.

The primary concepts and goals of this project is following

1. One cl-waffe2 code, consisted of multiple and user-extensible backends, which consisted of small pieces of backends.

2. Everything is lazy-evaluated, and compiled.

3. defined-and-run, closer to defined-by-run APIs.


**Everything in this documentation is incomplete! I guess should be much more polished!**
