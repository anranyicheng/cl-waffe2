# Formulate Neural Networks
The package `:cl-waffe2/vm.nodes` provides a fundamental system for building neural networks.

This package can be divided into three main parts.

1. Shaping APIs
2. defnode  (Differentiable Operations)
3. defmodel (Operations consisted of defnode)

## Shaping APIs


## Introducing Subscript DSL

I assume you have already seen `defnode` macro. This macro takes a strange syntax language after :where keyword.

```lisp
(defnode (TransposeNode (myself)
            :where (A[~ i j] -> A[~ j i])
         ...))

(defnode (ScalarAdd (myself)
            :where (A[~] Scal[scal] -> A[~] where scal = 1)
        ...))

(defnode (ReshapeNode (myself tensor after &aux (before (shape tensor)))
            :where (A[before] -> A[after])
        ...))
```

This is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) called `Subscript DSL`, which is used to notate the pointer and shape to be handled before and after the operation.

For example, `TransposeNode` is said to be:

1. Before and after the operation, we use the same pointer.

2. A is a tensor with more than two dimensions, and after the operation, transposed the last two axes. (i.e.: A=(10 5 2), (10 2 5) is returned)

`ScalarAdd` is said to be:

1. The first argument `A` can be anything. The second argument `Scal` is a scalar tensor.

2. The returned tensor shares the pointer with the given `A`.

`ReshapeNode` is:

1. Before and after the operation, pointers are common.

2. The shape of A will be transformed from `before` into `after`

### Basic Grammar

Let's start with learning the grammar.

One line code of Subscript DSL follows this format:

```
[Before The Operation] -> [After The Operation] where [symbol = expression (Optional)] ...
```

Note that:

1. the pharse `where [symbol = expression (Optional)] ...` is **Optional**

2. One Subscript DSL place can include one line of code.

3. [Before The Operation] and [After The Operation] has the common grammar rule.

Let `<Arguments>` be a grammar rule of [Before The Operation] and [After The Operation], `<Arguments>` can be defined as:

```
<Arguments> ::= <Arguments> <Argument>
<Argument> ::= <PointerName> [ <SubScripts> ] | NIL

<PointerName> ::= Symbol // the same as CL's symbol.

<SubScripts>  ::= <Subscripts> <Subscript>
<Subscript>   ::= Symbol | NIL
```

To put it bluntly, <Argument> can be a sequence of:

```c
PointerName[SubScripts]

// SubScripts can be one of: [A], [A B] [~ i j] etc...
```

### Assigned works

```
A[a b] B[a b] -> B[a b]
```

In the DSL above, `A` and `B` indicates the name of pointer, they're not needed to be defined in advance.

On the other hand `a` and `b` inside [ ... ], indicates subscripts of `A` and `B`, DSL's assigned work is to inference these **undetermined symbols** from:

1. local variables declared in `defnode` form or `where` pharse.

2. Shape of the given inputs at runtime.

If any, DSL compiles and display a report on `Shape-Error` before performing the operation.

```lisp
(!add (randn `(3 2)) (randn `(2 4)))
;; will produce...

[cl-waffe] Shaping-Error: Couldn't step forward because of shape-error.

The operation was : <Node: ADDNODE-CPUTENSOR (A[~] B[~] -> A[~])>

Input(s)            : ((3 2) (2 4))
Predicted Output(s) : ((3 2))

Here's a list of reports.

1. Couldn't idenfity ~: ~ is determined as 3 
 butgot: 2.
 Excepted ~ = (3 2), butgot: (2 4)

Also, these reports could be helpful for you (calculated ignoring the first errors.)

2. Couldn't idenfity ~: ~ is determined as 2 
 butgot: 4.
 Excepted ~ = (3 2), butgot: (2 4)
```

### Determine Rules

```
(defnode (ExampleNode (myself)
            :where (A[~ i j] B[~ j k] C[~ k i] -> C[~ k i])
         ...))
```

Symbols used in subscripts has a two state:

1. Determined (those that can say i=1, j=2!)

2. Undetermined (those that cannot say i=1, j=2)

Before doing `(call (ExampleNode) ...)`, we create a table which stores determined/undetermined symbols and corresponding values.

```
[TABLE]
~  -> ? // Undetermined before runtime
i  -> ? // Undetermined before runtime
j  -> ? // Undetermined before runtime
k  -> ? // Undetermined before runtime
```

The moment we do `(call (ExampleNode) TensorA TensorB TensorC)`, we will be able to inference the value of `i` `j` `k` from the shape of given TensorA, TensorB, and TensorC.

For Example, Let TensorA be a `2x3x4` Matrix, then the table become:

```
[TABLE]
~  -> 2
i  -> 3
j  -> 4
k  -> ? 
```

Then continue to do the same thing for TensorB. Let TensorB be a `2x4x9` Matrix, then the table become:

```
[TABLE]
~ -> 2
i -> 3
j -> 4
k -> 9
```

Last, applying this operation into TensorC, but what if I gave the wrong shape to TensorC? Let TensorC be a `999x999x999` Matrix. (Obviously this is wrong).

```
[TABLE]
~ -> 2 // ≠999
i -> 3 // ≠999
j -> 4 // ≠999
k -> 9 // ≠999
```

All subscripts in the table do not match with 999, resuting in shape-error.

In that case, we can try again the operation with giving the correct shape to TensorC. Let TensorC be `2x9x3` Matrix.

```
[TABLE]
~ -> 2 // =2
i -> 3 // = 3
j -> 4 // 
k -> 9 // = 9
```

All subscripts passed! (puts error If there's still undetermined symbol.)

Using the determined table, we can also inference the shape of output tensor. The returned tensor is the shape of `(~ k i)`, that is, `(2 9 3)`. This operation can be done in a chain of lazy-evaluated nodes.

Now, moving on to another topic, subscripts can be one of them.

```
[TABLE]

a = 1 // Fixnum

b = `(1 2) // List consisted of fixnum

~ = `(1 2 3) // ~ is a special symbol which represents batched-input.
```

DSL flattens the list in the subscript. (e.g.: `b=(1 2)` in `A[b]` is the equivalent to `A[1 2]`)

**Note that** ~ is a reserved word and has a special rule:

1. ~ is used to express dimensions from 0 to N

2. ~ can only be used once for one input of subscript.

3. In tables, ~ is interpreted as one of: `NIL` or `List`

In addition, ~ has a three behaviour:

1. If ~ never appears in [Before The Operation] and [After The Operation] parts, the length of ~ could be Any.

2. If ~ appears more than once, the length of ~ and content should be common.

3. If ~ appears only in [After The Operation], returns error because we can't determine ~.

In conclusion, I believe introducing Subscript DSL produces two benefits:

1. Rigorous Shape Inspection in all operations with small code, and produce better Shape-Error (Initially I'm inspired in: [nalgebra](https://github.com/dimforge/nalgebra)).

2. JIT Compiler can use a shape of given arguments in advance. (If only CL has a const-generics like Rust, Subscript DSL isn't needed anymore!).
